## Task 1: Data Analytics<br>
In this section, turnover analytics should be investigated to uncover valuable insights (include short-term aggregated turnover forecast). Additionally, a detailed analytical report is desired on the sellers and products listed on our marketplace.<br>

`Turnover Analytics:` <br>
* Aggregated turnover,
* Turnover in categories,
* Growing Categories,
* Most valuable categories,
* Declining Categories,
* Least valuable categories.<br>

`Sellers Analytics:` <br>
* Top 10 sellers by Revenue,
* Average Order Value by Seller,
* Average daily revenue for each seller,
* Best seller within each category,
* Sellers with the Highest Number of Reviews,
* Top Sellers by Customer Satisfaction Score.<br>

`Products Analytics:` <br>
* Top 10 Products by Revenue,
* Top 10 Products by Total Units Sold,
* Average daily revenue for each product,
* Best product within each category,
* Average Product Weight by Category,
* Average Product Price by Category,
* Average Review Score by Product Category,
* Products with the Highest Number of Reviews,
* Top Products by Customer Satisfaction Score.

## Task 2: Forecasting<br>
The goal is to perform demand forecasting for each product category.<br><br>
Notes:
* Demand is assumed to be synonymous with the value of things,
* Expected forecasting horizon is around 14 days,
* Weekly seasonality is reportedly alleged (according to `Data Card` description).

## Task 3: Analysis of Sentiment<br>
This section implements functionality to classify comments as positive, neutral or negative using RoBERTa model. Fameous transformer architecture.<br><br>
Key findings include `most endorsed products and sellers`.<br>

`Database Updates:` <br>
* Added `sentiment` column into an `order_reviews` table,
*  Added `text_rating` column into an `order_reviews` table.<br><br>

### About Dataset 
The file `transactional_data.db` is an SQLite database that contains five tables relevant to marketplace transactions. Each table captures specific aspects of the transaction process and is designed to support various types of analyses. Hereâ€™s an overview of the tables included:
