## Task 1: Forecasting<br>
The primary objective of this section is to develop a system for forecasting demand over a short-term period (14 days), starting 7 days after the latest date in the data provided, for all product categories. This system will utilize the transaction data you have. It is crucial to ensure the system can generate forecasts for new products with limited or no historical data. We aim to compare two methods: machine learning and traditional time series forecasting. The chosen technical solution must be supported by comments on the suitability of each method or approach.<br><br>

## Task 2: Analysis of sellers and products<br>
In this section, we require an analytical report on sellers and products listed on our marketplace. Using the provided data on sellers and products, the report should include: sellers with the highest and lowest turnover, top and bottom performers in sales within each category. For products, we need turnover analysis, identification of best-selling items in each category, and the relationship between product weight, turnover, and price. Additionally, segmentation of sellers and products with textual insights on the business implications of these results is of interest. <br><br>

## Task 3: Analysis of product semantics<br>
Our database includes numerical product ratings accompanied by text reviews. I understand that modern algorithms can interpret and analyze these reviews. Let's implement functionality to classify comments as positive or negative and compile the analytics. I am interested in the correlation between text comments and numerical ratings (1-5), identifying products with the best and worst reviews, and highlighting sellers who receive only negative feedback.
