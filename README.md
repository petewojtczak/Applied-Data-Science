## Task 1: Forecasting<br>
The objective of this section is to utilize the transaction_data database in order to develop a system for forecasting demand over a short-term period (21 days), for all product categories.<br><br>

## Task 2: Analysis of sellers and products<br>
In this section, we require an analytical report on sellers and products listed on our marketplace. Using the provided data on sellers and products, the report should include: sellers with the highest and lowest turnover, top and bottom performers in sales within each category. For products, we need turnover analysis, identification of best-selling items in each category, and the relationship between product weight, turnover, and price. Additionally, segmentation of sellers and products with textual insights on the business implications of these results is of interest. <br><br>

## Task 3: Analysis of product semantics<br>
Our database includes numerical product ratings accompanied by text reviews. I understand that modern algorithms can interpret and analyze these reviews. Let's implement functionality to classify comments as positive or negative and compile the analytics. I am interested in the correlation between text comments and numerical ratings (1-5), identifying products with the best and worst reviews, and highlighting sellers who receive only negative feedback.
