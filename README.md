## Task 1: Forecasting<br>
The main goal of this block is to implement a demand forecasting system for a short-term period (14 days) 7 days from the last date in the data for all product groups. We rely on the transaction data provided to you. It is important to make sure the system can produce a forecast for new products (which have little or no training data). We would like to see 2 approaches for comparison: using machine learning and classical time series forecasting.
The technical solution must be justified by comments regarding the appropriateness of a particular method or approach.<br><br>

## Task 2: Analysis of sellers and products<br>
In this block, we would like to see analytics of sellers and products presented on our marketplace. You have been provided with the following data: sellers, products – based on them, you need to build an analytical report, including: the sellers with the biggest/smallest turnover, leaders/outsiders in sales in each area. For products, we are interested in turnover analytics, which products sell best in each category, as well as the dependence of product weight on turnover and price. It is also interesting to see the segmentation of sellers and products with textual conclusions regarding the business value of using these results.<br><br>

## Task 3: Analysis of product semantics<br>
Our database contains information about numerical product ratings with text comments. I hear that modern algorithms can read and understand these reviews. Let’s implement the functionality for classifying positive/negative comments and consolidate the analytics. I’m interested in the correlation of text comments with a numerical rating (1-5), products with the best/worst reviews, sellers who only collect negative feedback.
