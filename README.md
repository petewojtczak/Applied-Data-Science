# Applied-Data-Science with SQLAlchemy

## Task 1: Forecasting<br>
The goal is to perform demand forecasting for each product category.<br><br>
Notes:
* Demand is assumed to be synonymous with the value of things,
* Expected forecasting horizon is around 14 days,
* Weekly seasonality is reportedly alleged (according to `Data Card` description).

## Task 2: Analysis of sellers and products<br>
In this section, turnover analytics should be investigated to uncover valuable insights. Additionally, a detailed analytical report is desired on the sellers and products listed on our marketplace.<br><br>

`Turnover Analytics:` <br>
* Growing Categories,
* Most valuable categories,
* Declining Categories,
* Least valuable categories.<br>

`Sellers Analytics:` <br>
* Top 10 sellers by Revenue,
* Average Order Value by Seller,
* Average daily revenue for each seller,
* Best seller within each category,
* Sellers with the Highest Number of Reviews,
* Top Sellers by Customer Satisfaction Score.<br>

`Products Analytics:` <br>
* Top 10 Products by Revenue,
* Top 10 Products by Total Units Sold,
* Average daily revenue for each product,
* Best product within each category,
* Average Product Weight by Category,
* Average Product Price by Category,
* Average Review Score by Product Category,
* Products with the Highest Number of Reviews,
* Top Products by Customer Satisfaction Score.

## Task 3: Analysis of product semantics<br>
Our database includes numerical product ratings accompanied by text reviews. Let's implement functionality to classify comments as positive or negative and compile the analytics. I am interested in the correlation between text comments and numerical ratings (1-5), identifying products with the best and worst reviews, and highlighting sellers who receive only negative feedback.<br><br>

### About Dataset 
The file `transactional_data.db` is an SQLite database that contains five tables relevant to marketplace transactions. Each table captures specific aspects of the transaction process and is designed to support various types of analyses. Hereâ€™s an overview of the tables included:

- **`sellers`**: Contains information about sellers, including `seller_id` (pk) and `seller_state`. This table has 2,970 records.
  
- **`products`**: Lists details about products available on the marketplace, including `product_id` (pk), `product_category_name`, and `product_weight_g`. This table includes 32,216 records.

- **`orders`**: Provides details about each order, such as `order_id` (pk), `timestamp`, and `customer_contact`. This table has 96,478 records.

- **`order_items`**: Serves as a container for a set of items associated with each order, with columns such as `order_items_pk` 
(pk), `order_id`(fk), `product_id`(fk), `seller_id`(fk), and `price`. This table contains 110,197 records.

- **`order_reviews`**: Includes reviews associated with each order, with columns like `review_id` (pk), `order_id` (fk), `review_score`, and `review_comment_message`. This table has 39,462 records.
